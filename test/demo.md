So far many programmers like using `Java` to build microservices project. A lot of microservices related libs are presented in Java Community, such as `Eureka`, `Feign`, `Ribbon` and so on.

~~~java
public class SomeClass<T extends Runnable> {
    protected T field = null;
    private final String greet = "Hello World!";

    /**
     * This is a main method.
     * @param args arguments.
     * @return zero
     */
    public static int main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new SomeClass<>().greet);
        System.out.println(new SomeClass<>().getGreet());
        return 0;
    }

    public String getGreet() {
        return this.greet;
    }
}

$$ \mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 =  \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ \frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} & 0 \\ \frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} & 0 \\ \end{vmatrix} $$
